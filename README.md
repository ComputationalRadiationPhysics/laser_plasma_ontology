The first version of [laser-plasma ontology](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/laser_plasma_ontology/blob/master/laser-plasma_ontology.rdf) is provided by [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)  which is one of the most famous and well-established software for ontology creation. The ontology is saved in RDF/XML format which is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for representing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data and is widely adopted in the semantic web community. It is a standard model for representing data and metadata on the web. RDF provides a framework for expressing relationships between resources in a machine-readable format, enabling data interchange and integration across different applications and systems.
To update/edit the ontology you first need to install Protégé on your system. Then open the app and on the top menu select: _File-> open_. To visualize from the top menu select: _Window-> Tabs_ -> and select _OWLViz_ or _OntoGraf_.  Here you can find a short documentary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nC2GDnfbnU) on how to use these features. 
[OWLGrEd](http://owlgred.lumii.lv/) is also a software that is easy to understand and can be used even with "non-ontologists" to view the structure of ontology online in a web browser without specific expertise. We need to upload the ontology where OWLGrEd will present the structure of the ontology.
